  <p>Camera quality significantly impacts photo quality, particularly for those prioritizing 
    technical excellence and professional results. A better camera, with features like larger
    sensors and faster autofocus, can lead to sharper images, better low-light performance, 
    and improved handling of fast-moving subjects. However, the importance of camera quality 
    should be balanced with the creative vision and narrative of the photographer.
